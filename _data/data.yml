    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
      University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.  I'm currently working under the supervision of
      Professor Arindam Banerjee. I have broad interests in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
      My work includes large scale learning, stochastic gradient algorithms, and Sequence-to-Sequence 
      model for sub-seaonal forecasting.

experiences:
    - role: Research Assistance
      time: Present
      company: University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
      title: Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecasting with Machine Learning
      details: |     
        - Build novel Sequence-to-sequence models for sub-seasonal forecasting (forecasting 14-28 days ahead of time) 
        that better handles the long-term temporal dependencies in climate time series.
        - Design proper evaluation pipeline to validate model performances on small-scale time series dataset.
        - Collect and propose a useful benchmark dataset as the ‘Imagenet’ dataset for sub-seasonal forecasting.
        - Wrote 1000+ lines of python/pytorch-code implementing 5+ baseline models, e.g. LSTM-Autoencoder.

    - role: Research Assistance
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company:  University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
      title:  Empirical study of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)&colon; Dynamics
      link: "../_docs/sgd_dynamics.md/"
      details: |         
          - Studied the properties of loss surfaces of deep Relu network through the Hessian matrix
          - Unveiled a novel observation of the overlap between the principal eigen-spaces of the Hessian 
          and the second moment of the stochastic gradients.
          - Implemented a python/pytorch toolbox for efficient computation of eigenvalues 
          and eigenvectors of large-scale matrices with millions of entries.


    - role: Research Assistance
      time: 2017 - 2018
      company: University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
      title: Deep Neural Network for Land Climate Prediction using Sea Surface Temperatures
      details: |
        - Designed deep neural network for land climate prediction using a small climate dataset 
        containing high-resolution (high dimensional) sea surface temperature data.
        - Applied transfer learning on pre-trained VGG-Net and ResNet to solve the same climate prediction problem.

    - role: Research Assistance
      time: 2014 - 2017
      company: University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
      title: Computer-Aided Cancer Diagnosis in Surgical Pathology
      link: "#hook"

      details: |
        
        - Built deep neural network with special feature descriptor to perform diagnosis 
        on malignant and benign neoplasms of the endometrium, prostate, breast, ovary and myometrium, 
        squamous intraepithelial lesions of the lower female genital tract, and histopathologic diagnosis 
        of non-neoplastic pulmonary diseases, with average prediction accuracy over 90%.
