    summary: |
      I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
      University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.  I'm currently working under the supervision of
      Professor Arindam Banerjee. I have broad interests in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
      My work includes large scale learning, stochastic gradient algorithms, and Sequence-to-Sequence 
      model for sub-seaonal forecasting.

      company: Startup Hubs, San Francisco
      details: |
        - Build novel Sequence-to-sequence models for sub-seasonal forecasting (forecasting 14-28 days ahead of time) 
        that better handles the long-term temporal dependencies in climate time series.
        - Design proper evaluation pipeline to validate model performances on small-scale time series dataset.
        - Collect and propose a useful benchmark dataset as the ‘Imagenet’ dataset for sub-seasonal forecasting.
        - Wrote 1000+ lines of python/pytorch-code implementing 5+ baseline models, e.g. LSTM-Autoencoder.
